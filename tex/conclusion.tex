\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we introduce \framework, an optimization framework that features a scheduling language with scheduling commands for targeting multicore CPUs, GPUs, and distributed systems.  A four-layer intermediate representation that separates the algorithm, the schedule, the data layout and the communication is used to implement the proposed scheduling language.
We evaluate \framework by targeting a variety of backends and demonstrate that it generates code matching and outperforming state-of-the-art frameworks.
