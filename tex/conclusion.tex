\section{Conclusion}

This paper introduces \framework, an optimization framework that features a scheduling language with scheduling commands for targeting multicore CPUs, GPUs, and distributed systems.  A four-layer intermediate representation that separates the algorithm, when and where computations occur, the data layout and the communication is used to implement the scheduling language.
We evaluate \framework by targeting a variety of backends and demonstrate that it generates code matching and outperforming state-of-the-art frameworks.
